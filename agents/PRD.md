# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

The Project Requirements below contains all information needed to build out this website. For the buildout of this website we take it in steps, rather than one-shoting the entire buildout.

## Steps

| Step | Focus                                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Start by design aesthetics of the site and involves modifying the main.css file to set ui style and branding, and nuxt.config to set fonts. |
| 2    | Build out the homepage content and section components.                                                                                      |
| 3    | Update the SiteHeader and SiteFooter components.                                                                                            |
| 4    | Build out the about and contact page.                                                                                                       |
| 5    | Await users next step.                                                                                                                      |
